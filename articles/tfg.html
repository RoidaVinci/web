    <p>During my last year as an undergraduate student of Mathematics I wrote a thesis in Neural Network and Applications. When writing it, my aim was to structure the current state of the art knowledge and make it easier to understand for someone with a mathematical background, rather than the usual articles which are written in a style more suited for someone with a CS reader in mind. Over everything, I aimed to understand a fast evolving and broad field rather than focusing too much on details that might fall out of use really soon. However, I did focus in the underpins of some of the more essential and established parts of the Deep Learning domain, such as the empirical risk minimization framework and the gradient descent based training algorithms.</p>
