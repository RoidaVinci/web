I graduated from the [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), focusing in the [Master of Mathematical Statistics](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/mapmasmst/study). Before, I was an undergraduate student in Mathematics at the [University of Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.gal/en). Through this years I participated in different research projects covering different applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In particular, I was part of a research project at [CITIUS](https://citius.gal/), [IDIS](https://www.idisantiago.es/en/) and [Applied Mathematics department of USC](https://www.usc.gal/en/department/applied-mathematics) department.
